                <h2 class="tm-mb-2 tm-title-color"> Cacao Ceremony</h2>
<p>A ritual to renew and remember our embodied wisdom with the heart opening medicine of cacao, amplified through an intimate gathering. Cacao has been used ceremonially by the Mayans for thousands of years. It opens the blood vessels, increases vitality by releasing dopamine and endorphins, and is known to aid in creating space in the body to feel both grounded and uplifted.
    <br> <br>Chloe sources the cacao directly from farmers in Batangas, Philippines. The ceremonial cacao is not sold commercially. Chloe integrates ancestral Filipino wisdom and Mayan cosmology as historical references. Chloe will guide the ceremony through a purifying fire ritual, ceremonial drinking, and guided movement.
