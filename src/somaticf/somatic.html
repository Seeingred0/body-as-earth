                    <p>Somatic touch therapy involves gentle holding of the body. It can be very helpful during times of stress, illness, and recovery. You may connect to the unspoken story of the body which is important if you are feeling disconnected or have experience with trauma. The main function of the work is to provide a physical experience of support. When our bodies are working overtime, our capacity decreases. Through touch, we can increase our capacity for coping, recovering, and thriving.
                        <br> <br>
                        So much of our experience is non-verbal, unexpressed, and decontextualized as simply ‘part of us’. Our therapists are going to take time to get to know you, listen to your story and work with you to illuminate your ‘why’.
                        <br> <br>
                        ‘Why am I like this?’ <br>
                        ‘Why do I have these physical or mental health symptoms?’ <br>
                        ‘Why can’t I fix it/change it?’<br>
                        ‘Why do I feel not quite right?’<br>
                        ‘Why does it feel like this isn’t really my life? (of the life I want?’<br>
                        ‘Why am I in pain?’<br>
                        ‘Why do I have problems with my personal relationships?’

                    The intention is to help the nervous system feel safe and provide an experience of support. Sometimes when we exceed our capacity, we are not able to self-regulate. This kind of touch provides a co-regulatory approach; which means that someone else helps us to regulate. At birth, we require co-regulation to learn to self-regulate; that is, we need our caregiver to help us feel safe. When we are working towards recovery, or experiencing stressors, co-regulation can help us navigate our experience.
